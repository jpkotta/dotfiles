it would be nice to be able to click on the swallowed xclock in DesktopButtons
    and toggle the button bar. however, there is a known bug with binding actions
    to swallowed buttons, it just doesn't work.  this true as of v2.5.16.

arrange post it notes automatically (someone has most likely done this already)
    Here's a solution, but it doesn't work well, and isn't really necessary
    Style XPostit !UsePPlacement
    DestroyFunc RearrangePostitNotes
    AddToFunc RearrangePostitNotes
    + I    All (XPostit) PlaceAgain
    + I    All (XPostit) PlaceAgain

fix PickAgain (gets called twice sometimes on FvwmIdent)

nedit's find dialog generates a "string not found" popup that's not focused, so
it's annoying to manually focus and close it.  it is an fvwm setting because in
enlightenment, it is focused
    ClickToFocus style seems to be the culprit

many things would be much easier with a third icon for each window.  this would
    make it easy to do the screenshot winlist, the big pager, and to write an
    expose extension.
