"""
This is a very simple command line calculator.  It reads in all
arguments as a single string and runs eval() on them.  The math module
is imported so you have access to all of that.  If run with no
arguments, it allows you to input a single line expression.  In the
case of command line args, square brackets are replaced with round
parentheses, because many shells interpret round parentheses if they
are not quoted.
